  - LGPL-2.1
  - :who: Vadim Kononov
    :why: The Lesser General Public License is a more permissively copyleft license compared to the GPL. It allows you to link to libraries without making your own source code GPL-licensed, but if you modify the LGPL-licensed library itself, those modifications must be released under the LGPL. It's suitable for commercial applications, especially in non-commercial contexts as noted, but with some considerations regarding library modification and distribution.
